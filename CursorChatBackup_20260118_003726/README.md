- **Project Path**: E:\Unity Assets Projects\Quiz_Master
- **Project Name**: Quiz_Master
- **Workspace Storage ID**: b29eaa45ab471e2e7d2cfd0688a18c81

## Contents
This backup contains:
1. **Workspace Storage** - Contains chat history database (`state.vscdb`) and workspace-specific data
2. **History Entries** - Recent workspace history entries (last 90 days)
3. **Project Context** - Your `.cursorrules` file for project context (if present)

## How to Restore

### Option 1: Restore to Same Account
1. Close Cursor completely
2. Navigate to: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage\b29eaa45ab471e2e7d2cfd0688a18c81\`
3. Backup the existing folder (rename it to `workspaceStorage_backup`)
4. Copy the contents of `workspaceStorage\b29eaa45ab471e2e7d2cfd0688a18c81\` from this backup to the location above
5. Restart Cursor - your chat history should be restored

### Option 2: Restore to New Account
1. After switching to your new Cursor account, open the project in Cursor
2. Locate the new workspace storage directory:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage\[NEW_WORKSPACE_ID]`
   - Find it by checking the `workspace.json` file in each directory for your project path
3. Close Cursor
4. Copy the contents of `workspaceStorage\b29eaa45ab471e2e7d2cfd0688a18c81\` to your new workspace storage directory
5. Restart Cursor - your chat history should be restored

### Option 3: Reference Only
If automatic restoration doesn't work:
1. Open the exported files to review past conversations
2. Share important context with the AI in new chats
3. The `.cursorrules` file will automatically provide project context

## Important Notes
- Chat history is stored in the `state.vscdb` SQLite database
- Always close Cursor before copying/restoring files
- Workspace storage IDs are unique per workspace
- Some chat data might be encrypted or tied to your account
- Always create a backup before attempting restoration

## Files in This Backup
- `workspaceStorage/` - Complete workspace storage backup
- `History/` - Recent workspace history entries
- `.cursorrules` - Project context and rules (if present)

## Troubleshooting
If chat history doesn't restore:
1. Ensure Cursor is completely closed before copying files
2. Verify file permissions on the destination directory
3. Check that the workspace storage ID matches (or find the correct one)
4. Try opening the `state.vscdb` file with a SQLite browser to verify contents
5. Contact Cursor support if issues persist
